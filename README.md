In this project I will analyze data related to dogs that are available for adoption in the USA.

The dataset I'm working on is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/adoptable-dogs-in-the-us

The data were gathered from a popular social network called Petfinder that help user to either adopt a dog or find a new home for their four paws friend. There are about 58k entries in the dataset, each one representing a different dog.

In this analysis I will try to answers to the following questions:
 - What is the distribution of dogs' gender, size and age?
 - How many dogs are thoroughbred? For thoroughbred dogs, which breeds are the most common?
 - What are the most common names for dogs? Do the names change in relation to the dog size?
 - Is there are difference in the percentage of house trained dogs given their size?
 - Is there are difference in dogs' coat length given the temperature of the state?
 - Where do the dogs come from?
 - Is there a difference in the percetage of vaccinated dogs given the state? And what about the percentage of thoroughbred dogs?
 - Do the most common words used for describing dogs change accordingly to the dog age or breed?
